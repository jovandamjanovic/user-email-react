This is a project I built for the interview at a company. The requirements were as follows:

- The app begins with an empty list of users, and an 'Add new User' button.
- The button opens a separate dialog to add a new user.
- The updating and/or removal of individual entries from the list is to be carried out through the same dialog opening upon clicking on the list.
- The app should also carry out validation of the inputs and inform the user of his errors.
